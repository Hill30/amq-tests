####Test case description:
 
 * for every connection in the batch
   - initiates the connections. The name of the client and the topic is generated by appending the connection number to the client/topc name prefix.
   - waits for up to 1000ms for the connect op to complete
   - as soon as the connection is established, subscribes to the topic (if requested)

 * for every established connection after a random interval expires
   - sends a message to be received by the connection
   - message payload includes counter of the messages sent to the connection so far
   - increments the message counter for the connection
   - when the message received checks the counter in the message payload with the counter of the messages received 
   - increment the counter of the messages received
 
 * the client accepts commands typed in the stdIn
   - `disconnect` disconnects all clients
   - `restart` restarts the test by disconnecting all clients and then recreating them
   - ctrl-D disconnects all clients and quits the program

####Test parameters
 * broker url
 * topic prefix name
 * client prefix name
 * Quality of service
 * batch size
 * message send interval (number of messages per connection per day)

####Running instructions
 * Load the source code in the IDE (JetBrains Idea Community edition worked for me)
 * Set the parameters listed above to the desired values. I ran the test with the batch size of 10000
 * Wait for the connect process to complete
 * Cut off access to the broker i.e. using firewall. Watch the connection count on the broker to run down to 0
 * Restore access to broker. Watch the connection count to go back up to 10000
