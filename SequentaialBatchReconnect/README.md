####Test case description:
 
 * for every connection in the batch
   - initiates the connections. The name of the client and the topic is generated by appending the connection number to the client/topc name prefix.
   - waits for up to 1000ms for the connect op to complete
   - as soon as the connection is established, subscribes to the topic (if requested)

 * for every connection in the batch
   - if the connection is lost (or never established) reconnects
 
 * repeates the connection check after 1000ms delay
 
 * the client accepts commands typed in the stdIn
   - `disconnect` disconnects all clients
   - `restart` restarts the test by disconnecting all clients and then recreating them
   - ctrl-D disconnects all clients and quits the program

####Test parameters
 * broker url
 * topic prefix name
 * client prefix name
 * Quality of service
 * batch size

####Running instructions
 * Load the source code in the IDE (JetBrains Idea Community edition worked for me)
 * Set the parameters listed above to the desired values. I ran the test with the batch size of 10000
 * Wait for the connect process to complete
 * Cut off access to the broker i.e. using firewall. Watch the connection count on the broker to run down to 0
 * Restore access to broker. Watch the connection count to go back up to 10000
